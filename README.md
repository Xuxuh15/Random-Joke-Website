# Generate Joke Website

This project is a simple web application that generates random jokes for users when they click a button. The purpose of this project is to provide an opportunity for developers to practice making GET requests to public APIs.

The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It uses the [icanhazdadjoke](https://icanhazdadjoke.com/) API to fetch random jokes and display them on the page.

## Installation

To use this application, you can clone the repository to your local machine by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Xuxuh15/Random-Quote-Website.git
```

Once you have cloned the repository, you can open the `index.html` file in your web browser to use the application.

## Usage

To use the application, simply click the "Generate Joke" button on the page. Each time you click the button, a new joke will be fetched from the API and displayed on the page.
